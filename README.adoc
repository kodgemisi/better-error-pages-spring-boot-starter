This is a `Spring Boot Starter` project which provides Rails like error pages for Spring Boot applications for development environments.

For **rest requests**, any error is archived until a configurable `timeout` and the error page url is sent in rest request's response headers.

== Demo

https://better-error-pages-demo.herokuapp.com

Note that demo page is a Heroku app so it may be sleeping when you first open the page, it may take 1-2 min for server to wake up.

== Quick Start

Just add the dependency to your maven/gradle of your Spring Boot application then it will autoconfigure itself and
_Better Error Pages_ will be available if your active profiles includes `dev` or `development`.

**Adding the dependency to your project**

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.kodgemisi</groupId>
    <artifactId>better-error-pages-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${better-error-pages-spring-boot-starter.version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

See https://jitpack.io/#kodgemisi/better-error-pages-spring-boot-starter for Jitpack usage, dependency details, version info and Gradle usage.

== Configuration

Better Error Pages;

* sets `server.error.include-stacktrace: always` and `server.error.include-exception: true` automatically.
* autoconfigures itself if active profile has `dev` or `development` however you can override this via `better-error-pages.profiles` property.
* finds your `@SpringBootApplication` annotated class and use its package name as `better-error-pages.package-name` name however you can override this via `better-error-pages.package-name` property.

TIP: Note that `package-name` should be typically your own base package which is used throughout your own classes like `com.yourcompany`.

```yaml
better-error-pages:
  package-name: <String> # A package name whose classes' source code will be parsed and displayed in error pages.
  profiles: <String or List of string> # Override default profiles to enable Better Error Pages. Default value: "dev, development"
```


IMPORTANT: Setting `better-error-pages.package-name` property improves startup performance significantly but won't affect runtime performance.

[WARNING]
====
If you set `better-error-pages.package-name` property then your project must have **one of** following files:

* application.yml
* application-dev.yml
* application.properties
* application-dev.properties
====

== Limitations

* Won't work for package names containing upper case characters.
* Can't show source code in multi module projects only if the project is run as packaged but other features will work.
  ** When running multi module projects from an IDE everything just works.
